# credit-card-segmentation

Project Objective: The primary objective was to identify different segments within the existing customer base based on their spending patterns and past interactions with the bank.

Methodology Overview: The project involved comprehensive data processing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the application of five clustering models. Additionally, dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA and t-SNE were employed for visualizing clustering results.

Key Insights: After thorough evaluation, I found that K-means and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) emerged as the top-performing models for segmenting credit cards. These models showcased superior accuracy and effectiveness in identifying distinct customer segments.

Results and Impact: By leveraging K-means and GMM, I successfully segmented the credit card customer base, enabling targeted marketing campaigns and service improvements. These findings provide actionable insights for personalized customer engagement and service delivery enhancements.

Further Investigation: A deeper dive into how K-means and GMM segmented credit cards based on various features within the dataset revealed underlying patterns and behaviors driving customer segmentation.
